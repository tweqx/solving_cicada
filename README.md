## Attempts
For each solving attempt, several elements are given: a title summarizing its conclusion, solvers to contact if more detailed are needed, a link to a more thorough description of the analyses done.
While the summary are quite affirmative, they should not be taken as absolute truth. They are aimed at giving the consensus among solvers regarding the conclusion of the solving attempt.

Unless stated otherwise, contacts given are Discord handles, which they explicitely agreed to being listed there. As ideas often are not original and thus there is no guarantee that solvers credited were the first one to try what they are credited for. More generally, you can always contact `tweqx` to ask about a solving attempt (as she verifies every solving attempt listed here).

There is a huge sampling biais in the way solving attempts are added to this list. Thus, this repository is not be used as exhaustive list of everything that has been tried or as an way to list the most productive solvers (which would anyway be stupid to do).

Contributions are welcome, either by openning [an issue](https://github.com/tweqx/solving_cicada/issues) or by asking nicely to `tweqx` on Discord.

### Cicada OS
* [`560.13` is not an OpenPGP Secret Key](./cicadaos/560.13_not_openpgp_secret_key/README.md)
  
  `file` reports `560.13` has being an "OpenPGP Secret Key". This is a false positive.
